# AjcUtils

AjcUtils is a Console App written in C# that takes advantage of some abilities of the Animal Jam Classic client intended for devs, like enabling the Inspect tool, Auto-Clearing cache on exit, Enabling/Disabling client updates, etc. This isn't anything special but I plan on adding more features and making it less jank over time.

> When cloning this repo, be sure to use `git clone --recursive` to include submodules as well or it won't build. I'm using [AsarSharp](https://github.com/MWR1/asarsharp) to extract and modify the `app.asar`, I reccomend giving it a star.
