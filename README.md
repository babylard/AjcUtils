AjcUtils is a Console App written in C# that takes advantage of some abilities of the Animal Jam Classic client only intended for devs, like enabling the Inspect tool, Auto-Clearing cache on exit, Enabling/Disabling client updates, etc. It isn't too much but I plan on adding more features and making it less jank over time.
