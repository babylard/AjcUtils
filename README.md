AjcUtils is a Console App written in C# that takes advantage of some abilities of the Animal Jam Classic client only intended for devs, like enabling the Inspect tool (which is all for now ðŸ’€). It also allows you to clear the cache without having to navigate a bunch of folders. It isn't too much but I plan on adding more features and making it less jank over time.
